Record, sequence, shuffle.  
  
VIDEO WALKTHROUGH - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjNQ9qYwpQo&feature=youtu.be

Sequencer app uses jQuery to trigger sound enabled steps using the Web Audio API. Current version routes triggers to web audio oscillator tones or to a cowbell sample.  
  
Future Hopes:  
- Pop out sidebar controls to modify octave, waveform, attack, release, and more per step.  
- Offer library of samples to select per step using web sound libraries. Display sample waveforms to steps with Wavesurfer-js.
- Enable mic recording for creating custom samples per step.  
- Provide draggable playhead for sample-enabled steps. Playhead would change where in the sample file the step trigger plays from.
